    <p class = "info">Child abuse and violence affect millions of children each year. Child abuse includes physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect. Interpersonal violence is violence between people and includes community violence, partner violence (also called "domestic violence"), and bullying. After abuse or violence many children develop mental health problems including depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. These children may also have serious medical problems, learning problems, and problems getting along with friends and family members.</p>
<br>
<p class = "info">After abuse or violence children need support from their parents and other family members. Sometimes parents are not able to be supportive because they have their own mental health problems; or they may also have been the victims of the abuse or violence. Other parents may have caused the abuse or violence. Children who do not have supportive families or who blame themselves for the abuse or violence are more likely to have serious mental health problems.</p>
<br>
<p class ="info"> However, many children have inner strength and are able to cope well even after abuse or violence.</p>

    <p id = "myth"> <b> TRUTH : </b> Many children who experience abuse will not display physical signs. Child abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, or neglect, many of which do not leave clear markings. It is important to also watch for behavioral changes, an increase in anxiety and fear, decreased school performance, and a regression in development.</p>

      <center><p id = "myth"> <b> TRUTH : </b> 90% of all child sexual abuse victims know their abuser, often a family member, friend, parent, teacher, or other caregiver. Over 90% of victims who experienced child maltreatment were victimized by one or both parents. After parents, the most common perpetrators include foster parents, relatives, neighbors, and daycare providers.</p></center>

      <center><p id = "myth"> <b> TRUTH : </b> Unfortunately, there are a variety of reasons why children do not speak up, including having feelings of shame and fear. Not only should children be taught how to recognize if they are being abused and what to do about it, but they should also be made to feel safe and secure when reporting abuse.</p></center>
